# Deep-learning-
This repository is being created for the purpose of learning understanding the various deep learning algorithms During the course of our instructor dr Andrew Ng.The store purpose of this repository is to have better understanding and to enlighten others as well in the domain of deep learning and related concepts.There will be regular updates regarding all the lectures which I'll be seeing and then implementing them on my side.
About MNIST CLASSIFIER
What it does:

Takes handwritten digits as input (think scanned bills or messy notes).
Analyzes the pixels like a detective.
Identifies the digit with impressive accuracy (think Sherlock Holmes, but for numbers).
What it's built with:

TensorFlow: The brain behind the magic, crunching numbers and learning patterns.
Keras: A friendly API that makes TensorFlow less intimidating (think a translator for AI jargon).
MNIST dataset: A collection of 70,000 handwritten digits, the perfect training ground for our number sleuth.
What you can do:

Clone the repo and train the model on your own data! Customize it to recognize handwritten letters, symbols, or even your own doodles.
Dive into the code and explore the inner workings of a neural network. Uncover the secrets of how machines learn to recognize patterns.️‍♀️
Contribute to the project! Share your ideas, improve the code, and be part of a growing community of digit detectives.
